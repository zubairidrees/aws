replication in 3 AZ
each item max 400kb
can have null ,List map set

primary key 
	partion key 
	partition key + sort key (range key)
		data is group by parition key

WCU
no of objects * ceil(data in KB)

we write 6 objects per seconds of 4.5KB = 6*5 = 30WCU

write 120 objects per minute of 2 KB
120/60 *2

RCU
	Strongly consistent read (SCR) 
 	Eventually Consistant Read (ECR)
	
	one RCU represents one SCR per second upto 4 KB

	one RCU represents two ECR per second upto 4 KB

	ex.
	10 SCR per seconds of 4 KB each
	10 * 4/4 = 10 RCU

	16 ECR per seconds of 12 KB each

	(16/2) * (12/4) = 24 RCU

	10 SCR per seconds of 6 KB

	10 * 8/4 = 20 RCU (inbrement by 4)

to compute total partition
	by capicity : total rcu/3000 + total wcu/1000
	by size	: total size / 10 GB
	total partition = ceiling(max(capacity,size))

BatchWriteItem
up to 25 putitem or deleteitem in one call
up to 16 MB of data written
uo to 400 kb of data per item


ProjectionExpression to fetch certain attributes

BatchGetItem
	max 100 items
	up to 16 MB data

Query
	partition key has support of only = operator
	sortkey has (= < > <= >= between, begin)
	FilterExpression (client side)	
Scan/Query return up to 1 MB data

	can query on LSI or GSI

LSI (alternation range key)
	up to 5 LSI per table
	must be String Number Binary
	LSI can only defined at table creation time
	it's just like index any column other than partition key and sort key

GSI
	just like new table
	define a different partition & sort key 
	can be editable
	partition key and sort key of orignal table must be projected
	has different RCU & WCU
	can impact main table

DAX (cache)
5 minutes TTL by default
up to 10 modes in cluster (min 3 recommemded)

Dynamodb Stream
	24 hour data retention 			
	can acheive cross region relpication using stream
	attach lambda function on create/update or delete

Dynamodb TTL
	per row data will be deleted as per configured policy need to enable TTL and add date column

Dynamodb specific cli commands
--projection-expression
--filter-expression

all services have below cli commands
--page-size
--max-items
--starting-token

Transactional dynamodb opertions consumes 2x RCU/WCU
